## Why does the bot not announce birthdays?

**1st thing to check, have you set the birthday channel.**  
If not the bot has no idea where to wish you a happy birthday and will not send it. Use `b!setchannel <#channel>` to set that channel.

**2nd, has that user set their birthday?**  
Have the user run `b!getbday` and if the bot responds with "You have not set your birthday yet." Look at [Commands](commands.md#setting-your-birthday) to do so.

## When does the bot announce birthdays?

All birthdays will be announced at 12:00 noon in UTC. Once you set your birthday in one server with the Birthday Bot it will be announced in all servers the bot and you share.
